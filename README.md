# :computer: Autocomplete Widget :pencil:

Inspired by the Week 4 project mandate of Founders and Coders, the primary aim of this project is to practice applying core Node.js knowledge learned in part 1 of the course by building an autocomplete widget (or mini full-stack project!).

To enable a seamless experience in viewing the output, I have chosen to use a Pokedex JSON object used by alumni of FAC as a base for this project. See their project repo [here](https://github.com/fac-15/I-Choose-Who-)

## Minimum Viable Product :hatching_chick:

As one of the first projects on this learning path that is more or less full-stack in nature, the absolute minimum requirements I aimed for were:

1. A functioning server
2. Some form of modularisation (routers, handlers, etc.)
3. A functioning autocomplete feature for the input field presenting Pokemon names

## Main learnings / Takeaways :heavy_check_mark:

The short truth: trying to build this alone within the normal FAC project timeframe was soul crushing! However, this project also helped solidify a lot of the new concepts introduced in Week 4:

1. How to set up a server side from scratch and make it talk to the client side
2. Use of core Node.js modules including fs, path, http, and requiring own JS files within the project
3. Use of handler to organise endpoints and set up response
4. Applying XMLHttpRequest and DOM manipulation to reflect subsets of JSON as autocomplete options

## Stretch Goals / Further Improvements :runner:

1. Applying more CSS to the page
2. Have another section on the page which returns a property related to the selected Pokemon, like a true Pokedex!
